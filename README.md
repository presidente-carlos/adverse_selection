### 01.1 Parameters Generator Function
The user may want to adapt parameters according to the specific setting they are working in. Default values of \gamma = 0.02 and B = 10 have been inputed

### 01.2 Algorithm 1
The reader may consider modifiying `exp3_monop` to return additional information which is stored throughout the algorithmic process
The reader may want to change the number of periods an instance of $p_i$ is stored (default = 50)
The reader might want to set alternative parameters (default include parameters which ensure
